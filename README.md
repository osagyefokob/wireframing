# üß© Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

It outlines the **structure, layout, and flow** of content and interface elements without focusing on colors, images, or detailed visuals.

In other words, wireframes are the **skeletal maps** of a digital product ‚Äî showing *what goes where* and *how users will navigate.*
